    <p>The core rule of this sketch is that as the user presses "]," the phone will ring. A small circle will begin at the center of the screen with the word "ring." As the user clicks, the circle grows outwards. If the circles fill the canvas, the user has answered the phone, and the sketch will say "hello?" Otherwise, the ring will keep growing. The user can press "[" at any point to hang up the phone, bringing the system back to the beginning.</p>
