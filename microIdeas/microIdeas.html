<h1>Micro-Project Ideas</h1>
<h3>Wisdom</h3>
<p>Some people rent books from the library, others buy their books. One "pile" stacks quickly, as you can get many books from the library for cheap, while the other get stacked slowly; you have much less bang for your buck.</p>
<h3>Hesitation</h3>
<p2>A circle will appear larger and larger each time the user clicks the mouse. It will represent a phone. If the circles do not fill the screen, the sketch will say "ring." Once the user clicks enough times, the circle will fill the screen, and the user will be met with "Hello?"</p2>
<h3>Coasting</h3>
<p3>A simple sketch will show a red rectangle gliding across the blue screen. The rectangle will have a tail, showing its path as it coasts along. The coast will clear and reset after a few seconds on the screen.</p3>
