    <p>The array of pictures for this sketch together make a galloping horse. By clicking the right arrow, the horse will run. If the user clicks the left arrow, the horse will reverse. There is a stage counter that keeps the user aware of exactly which stage they are in. There is also an indicator at the bottom that will tell the user exactly what stage they are currently viewing, giving more control to the user.</p>
