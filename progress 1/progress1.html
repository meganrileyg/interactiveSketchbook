<h1>Micro-Project: Progress 1</h1>
<h2>Hesitation</h2>
<h3>Megan Gollaher</h3>
<p2>A circle will appear larger and larger each time the user clicks the "]" key. It will represent a phone. If the circles do not fill the screen, the sketch will say "ring." Once the user clicks enough times, the circle will fill the screen, and the user will be met with "Hello?" When the user clicks "[" the phone will "hang up," and be reset to the initital stage. Stage will = 0, with keyPressed controlling the sketch visually.</p2>
<p3>State 1: There is a small circle on the screen that reads, "Ring"<br>
    State 2: The circle grows larger and larger, and the text changes to "Hello?"<br>
    State 3: The user will "hang up" the phone, reseatting to the initial sketch.
</p3>
<br>
<p4>The system could grow will the implementation of a timer. For example, if the user has not clicked the "]" key in ten seconds, the sketch will automatically hang up. The threshold will be the maximum size of the circle, which could be the entire window. The sketch will escalate as it grows, and as the text grows with it.</p4><br>
