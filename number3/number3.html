        <p>This sketch represents the calm and quiet I experienced in the beginning of my morning. Opening up the store before the sun was even up, there was a sense of just gliding through my space. This is represented through the tail on the cursor, dragging along. The colors represent the shift from dark night into clear, quiet morning.</p>
