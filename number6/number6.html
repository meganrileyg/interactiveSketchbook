    <h1>IF/ELSE</h1>
    <h2>huzzah!</h2>

    <p>For this sketch, I decided to build a bridge that will help the user over some trechorous hills. The rule I designed is that with each click, a new piece of the bridge is built. If the bridge is not fully built, the sketch will guide the user with directions. Otherwise, once the bridge is complete, the user will be alerted that they've made it across, thus signaling that the state has changed. 
        In other words, if the bridge is unfinished, then I will build it. Otherwise, I will cross the bridge.</p>
