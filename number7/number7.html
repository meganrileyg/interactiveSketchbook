    <p>Some plants get watered, and others have to wait for the rain. I made this skecth to represent the growth process of two different plants, one who gets watered weekly, and one who has to wait for water whenever it comes. Over time, one plant may bloom beautifully, while the other can get dry or take twice as long.</p>
