    <p>Here is the array of pictures for this sketch! The images move with the right and left arrow keys to navigate forward and back, respectively, making the horse run! Once at the end, it will loop back to the beginning, thus allowing the horse to gallop forever. This lesson taught me how to include images as a navigation tool, though it took some troubleshooting to work out.</p>
